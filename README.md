# Error-Report
This script collects all system events with a level of 2 (Error) in the System log that occurred in the last 24 hours. It then counts the occurrences of each error message and the systems on which each error occurred. Finally, it sorts the error messages by the number of occurrences and the systems by the number of errors.
